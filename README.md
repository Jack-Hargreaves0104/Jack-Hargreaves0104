## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is John Hargreaves, but I go by Jack. I am currently a student at SUNY Brockport with a major in Computer Science, with a focus in Advanced Computing. I also have a minor in Cybersecurity. I plan to graduate in May 2026. As of right now, the plan is to attend grad school to further my education and get my Masters Degree. I am currently working on small personal projects as well as a larger group project. If you would like to contact me, my email is john.hargreaves0104@gmail.com. Have a nice day!
